These commands closely mirror the regular linux shell commands
they can each be run by typing ./<command>
valid commands are "oucat" "ouecho" "ouhead" "outail" "ouseq" and "ouwc"

assumptions made about this program in its writing include:
1. That any command not specifically designed to handle multiple files should be able to handle multiple files
2. That unless specified, no command line flags are to be valid
3. That if a set of command line flags are specified to be valid, then no otehr flags are to be valid
